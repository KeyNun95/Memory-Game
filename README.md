Test Your Meme-ory

My game is a card matching game used to improve users' memory and concentration in a fun way.The user is given a total of 20 cards and must finish by making 10 pairs. It is no secret that a memory game can strengthen semantic memory and concentration temporarily. By using "memes you can hear", a phase used to represent a meme that is commonly tied to a quote or sound, this makes the game enjoyable and further activate the recall function of the brain.
